Using hardcoded network passwords is not the ideal way to proceed. A better solution could be an asymmetric key pair system that is generated when the devices are initalized and is used for network data exchange. 

This tool was used for generating the current network password

Here is a library with code for assymetric keys

The code for unlinking a sensor is incorrectly implemented. With the current implementation, an offline sensor can not be removed from the main device since the main device will never get an ACK that the sensor has wiped the network credentials file. This sould be mentioned on the report.
